## Notes on Doing Research

### General Takeaways So Far

> **Deep understanding matters more than anything else.**  
>  
> One of the most important things I learned from my past research experience is the value of deep understanding in research, which is, never pretend that you understand. When you study a problem, you should not stop at the level of repeating someone else’s explanation. You should understand every part of it. If anything feels confusing, you should not pretend you understand. You should keep asking questions, again and again, unless you can barely find any questions. For the topic you are working on, you need to know it more deeply than anyone else.  
>  
> In practice, this means you should be able to answer questions clearly, no matter who asks them. If you truly understand something, you can explain it in the simplest language, and ideally you can walk others through a few concrete examples. The reason you can answer questions well is that, before others even ask, you should already anticipate many of the questions during your own thinking and research. Then you can use papers, references, AI tools, and your own reasoning to work toward solid answers. You also need to stay alert to any hidden assumptions behind an answer.  
>  
> The most important mindset is to be absolutely honest about what you know and what you do not know. Do not settle for shallow understanding. Face your gaps and ignorance directly, and do not be embarrassed to ask. Keep digging until you get to the bottom of the issue, and build a truly deep grasp of your research. This is also how he guided us. For every statement we made and every algorithm we proposed, he would try to understand it very thoroughly, not in a vague or superficial way, and never with empty, formal sounding talk (that I had with some other professor I had worked with).

> **First-principles thinking is essential.**  
>  
> The second thing I learned what is often called first principles thinking. It means setting aside what others have done and not getting trapped by the current status quo. Instead, you go back to the original starting point and focus on the real problem you are trying to solve. From there, you try to solve the problem itself, rather than simply building on top of someone else’s solution.

> **Think top-down, execute bottom-up.**  
>  
> From that foundation, we often use a top down approach. First, we state the problem clearly. That becomes the vision. Then we ask what directions might lead to a solution. Under each direction, we keep decomposing until the work becomes a set of small, executable tasks. Then we start with the next executable step.

> **Productivity follows physics.**  
>  
> Newton’s First Law of Motion states that an object will remain at rest or move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. The same applies to productivity. Often, the hardest part of a task is simply starting, because kinetic friction is less than static friction.  
>  
> Your next executable step should be small, because smaller steps reduce friction and make it easier to start. For example, if I want to run experiments, I may first need to modify code. Then my next executable step could be as simple as opening my laptop lid. After that, opening VS Code or PyCharm or Cursor, connecting to the HPC or the cloud, and continuing from there. Each step should be specific, small, and something you can hold yourself accountable to.
